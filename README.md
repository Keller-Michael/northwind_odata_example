# :globe_with_meridians: Northwind OData Access Example
 
 [Northwind](https://services.odata.org/) is a free public OData service for test purpose. I wrote a small [test class](src/zcl_mke_odata_client.clas.abap) with a http client (IF_WEB_HTTP_CLIENT, provided by CL_WEB_HTTP_CLIENT) to read customer data from Northwind in JSON format and to list data on ABAP Development Tools console. The example was made on SAP Business Technology Platform ABAP environment (Steampunk).
